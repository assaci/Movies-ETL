# Movies-ETL

## Overview 

Create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables.

### Deliverable 1: Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files

Using Python, Pandas, the ETL process, and code refactoring, write a function that reads in the three data files and creates three separate DataFrames.

### Deliverable 2: Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data

Using Python, Pandas, the ETL process, and code refactoring, extract and transform the Wikipedia data so you can merge it with the Kaggle metadata. While extracting the IMDb IDs using a regular expression string and dropping duplicates, use a try-except block to catch errors.

### Deliverable 3: Extract and Transform the Kaggle data

Using  Python, Pandas, the ETL process, and code refactoring, extract and transform the Kaggle metadata and MovieLens rating data, then convert the transformed data into separate DataFrames. Then, you’ll merge the Kaggle metadata DataFrame with the Wikipedia movies DataFrame to create the movies_df DataFrame. Finally, you’ll merge the MovieLens rating data DataFrame with the movies_df DataFrame to create the movies_with_ratings_df.

### Deliverable 4: Create the Movie Database

Using Python, Pandas, the ETL process, and code refactoring, extract and transform the Kaggle metadata and MovieLens rating data, then convert the transformed data into separate DataFrames. Then, you’ll merge the Kaggle metadata DataFrame with the Wikipedia movies DataFrame to create the movies_df DataFrame. Finally, you’ll merge the MovieLens rating data DataFrame with the movies_df DataFrame to create the movies_with_ratings_df.
